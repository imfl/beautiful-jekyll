直接标价法，间接标价法，基础货币/报价货币，报价货币/基础货币 ……  我知道，无非一个是另一个的倒数，但是谁是谁呢？

Direct quote, indirect quote, base currency, indirect currency, B/P, P/B, ... I know, ultimately, one is another's reciprocal. But, who is who?

So many times have I been confused with the currency pair terms  when I learned economics. This time, I determine to figure it out.

## Always Step 1: Figure out the Base Currency

The first step is figure out which currency is the *base currency*, or the currency that stays as one unit in the quote.

For example, in a currency pair between USD and JPY, the quote is around 100. You know the US dollar is the one that serves as one unit, so that US$1 equals around 100 Japanese Yen.

As another example, consider USD and GBP. If the quote is more than 1, not a fraction below 1.0, then you know GBP is the base currency. (Hope it stays true that 1 British pound is more worth than 1 US dollar.)

**The base currency is the always one that serves as one unit.**

Once base currency is set, there should be no controversy about the figure in the quote, no matter it is a direct or indirect quote, written in the B/P or P/B manner.

For example, so long as USD is the base currency, the quote figure between USD and JPY must be around 100, not around 0.01.

确定基础货币永远是弄清汇率报价的第一步，一旦确定了哪个货币是基础货币，对于报价的数字将不会有任何争议。

无论是直接标价法、间接标价法，还是写成$\dfrac{\text{基础货币}}{\text{报价货币}}$或是$\dfrac{\text{报价货币}}{\text{基础货币}}$，基础货币一确定，报价的数字就确定了。

例如，只要美元是基础货币，那么不论怎么标价、怎么写，美元与日元的汇率报价数字一定是100左右，而不是0.01左右。

### What is the other currency called, besides the base currency?

Either the price currency, or the quote currency, or, simply, the counter currency.

与基础货币相对应的是报价货币。

## Step 2: Direct Quote or Indirect Quote

**Whether it is direct quote or indirect quote largely depends where you are.**

| Direct Quote                           | Indirect Quote                          |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| uses foreign currency as base currency | uses domestic currency as base currency |

Consider a quote between USD and JPY that is around 100. The base currency is USD. If you are in New York, then the base currency is domestic, and the quote, accordingly, is indirect quote. However, if you are in Tokyo, with the same quote that's around 100, the quote is direct quote.

直接标价法还是间接标价法，取决于报价者的角度——基础货币是外币，则为直接标价法；基础货币是本币，则为间接标价法。

同样是数字为100左右、在美元和日元之间的汇率，在纽约，是间接标价（基础货币是本币，即美元），东京看来，就是直接标价（基础货币是外币，即美元）。

### Why it is called direct / indirect quote, not the other way round?

First of all, in a foreign exchange market, the foreign currency is ultimately the object that we care about.

- Direct quote is a *price* quote of the foreign currency. Consider in Tokyo, a quote of 100 between USD and JPY means that the price of 1 US dollar is 100 yen. Larger the figure, more expensive the foreign currency. So the quote directly tells the value of a foreign currency.
- Indirect quote is a *quantity* quote of the foreign currency.  Consider in New York, a quote of 100 between USD and JPY means that 100 units of JPY is equal in value to 1 unit of USD. Larger the figure, cheaper the foreign currency. So the quote indirectly tells the value of a foreign currency.
- 直接标价法直接标出了外币的（本币）价格。
- 间接标价法标示的是等值（单位本币的）外币的数量。

## Step 3: How to Express the Currency Pair

You may have noticed that up to this point I haven't written anything like USD/JPY. There could have been no confusion at all, were it not for the fact that people in the academia and people in the markets stick to two opposite expressing manners.

你可能注意到了，到目前为止，我还没有写任何像是$\dfrac{USD}{JPY}$ 这样的内容。事实上，如果不是学界和业界坚持要用两套不同的写法，这本来不会引起任何混淆。

The first thing to make clear is that whether to put base currency in the numerator or denominator has nothing to do with direct/indirect quote. Honestly, to me this is the chief culprit for most of the confusion. 

首先要弄明白，把基础货币放在分子还是分母的位置，和直接或是间接标价法无关。实话说，个人认为，这是引起外汇报价混淆的最大来源。

| Market Convention<br />市场习惯                              | (Certain) Academic Convention (like in CFA textbooks) <br />（某些）学术习惯（例如CFA教材） |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| $\dfrac{B}{P}$ or $\dfrac{\text{Base Currency}}{\text{Price Currency}}$ | $\dfrac{P}{B}$ or $\dfrac{\text{Price Currency}}{\text{Base Currency}}$ |

That is, for a quote that's around 100 between USD and JPY, the market convention is to express it as USD/JPY, while in certain textbooks it may be JPY/USD. In fact, the market is so sure about this convention that they define base currency as the first currency in the currency pair.

也就是说，如果是报价数字为100左右的美元、日元汇率，市场的写法是$\dfrac{USD}{JPY}$，而某些教材的写法却可能是$\dfrac{JPY}{USD}$。外汇市场本身，对于报价的写法是很统一的。事实上，外汇市场对于基础货币的定义就是：出现在外汇报价对中的第一种货币。

### How to Interpret?

For market convention (B/P), it is a ratio of value

市场的写法（即$\dfrac{\text{基础货币}}{\text{报价货币}}$）是很便于理解的：

$$
\Big[ \dfrac{\text{USD}}{\text{JPY}} \Big]_{\tfrac{B}{P}} = \dfrac{\text{Value of 1 USD}}{\text{Value of 1 JPY}} \approx 100
$$

For certain academic convention in the opposite manner, it has merit, too -- they resemble the way in physics, like $m/s$. That is, for 100 JPY/USD it presents 100 JPY for 1 USD. Consider you exchange US$ 2.5 to Japanese Yen.

某些写法相反的学术习惯（即$\dfrac{\text{报价货币}}{\text{基础货币}}$）也自有它们的道理。这种写法很像是物理上面的单位，像米/秒。这样，100 $\dfrac{JPY}{USD}$意味着100日元换1美元。比如你将2.5美元换成日元：

$$
2.5 \ \text{USD} \times \ \Big[ \dfrac{\text{JPY}}{\text{USD}} \Big]_{\tfrac{P}{B}} \approx 2.5 \ \text{USD} \times  100 \ \dfrac{\text{JPY}}{\text{USD}} = 250 \ \text{JPY}
$$
