*A demo of code for Project 1. Note how fast it is. Without a carefully designed data structure, it could take quite a few minutes.*

- For the C and Java code for the projects, click [here](https://github.com/imfl/derivative-pricing) (GitHub).

## 1. Pricing a derivative whose return is linked with two stocks

*using lattice tree method with forward shooting grid (FSG) techinique*

### More Information 

This project is a computer assignments that I did with Xue Sidan, for [*MAFS 5250 Computational Methods for Pricing Structured Products*](https://www.math.ust.hk/~maykwok/MAFS5250.htm), a postgraduate-level course that I took at the Math Dept. at HKUST in Summer 2017.

## 2. Pricing participating life insurance policies

*using fully implicit finite difference scheme*
