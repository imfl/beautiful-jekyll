*A demo of code for Project 1. Note how fast it is. Without a carefully designed data structure, it could take quite a few minutes.*

- For the C and Java code for the projects, click [here](https://github.com/imfl/derivative-pricing) (GitHub).

## 1. Pricing a derivative whose return is linked with two stocks

*using lattice tree method with forward shooting grid (FSG) techinique*

### More Information 

This project serves as a computer assignment that I did with Xue Sidan, for [*MAFS 5250 Computational Methods for Pricing Structured Products*](https://www.math.ust.hk/~maykwok/MAFS5250.htm), a postgraduate-level course that I took at the Math Dept. at HKUST in Spring 2017. This course is lectured by Prof. Yue-kuen Kwok. I am responsible for the code.

## 2. Pricing participating life insurance policies

*using fully implicit finite difference scheme*

## 3. Pricing an option on bond

*using a trinomial tree under the Hull-White model*

This project serves as an assignment that I did for *MAFS5040 Quantitative Methods for Fixed-Income Instruments*, a postgraduate-level course that I took at the Math Dept. at HKUST in Spring 2017. This course is lectured by Prof. Lixin Wu. I am responsible for the code.

## 4. Building a classical binomial tree

### More Information

This project serves as an assignment that I did for *MAFS 5260 : Building Financial Applications with Java and VBA*, a postgraduate-level course that I took at the Math Dept. at HKUST in Spring 2017. This course is lectured by Dr. Chung-dak Shum. I am responsible for the code.
