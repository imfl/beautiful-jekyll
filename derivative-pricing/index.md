*A demo of code for Project 1. Note how fast it is. Without a carefully designed data structure, it could take quite a few minutes.*

## 1. Pricing a derivative whose payoff is linked with two stocks

*using a two-state lattice tree with forward shooting grid (FSG) techinique*

The details of the financial derivative are [here](https://github.com/imfl/derivative-pricing/tree/master/two-state-lattice-fsg/que.pdf) (PDF).

The C code to price the strutured product is [here](https://github.com/imfl/derivative-pricing/blob/master/two-state-lattice-fsg/sol.c) (GitHub).

### More Information 

This project serves as a computer assignment that I did with Xue Sidan, for [*MAFS 5250 Computational Methods for Pricing Structured Products*](https://www.math.ust.hk/~maykwok/MAFS5250.htm), a postgraduate-level course that I took at the Math Dept. at HKUST in Spring 2017. This course is lectured by Prof. Yue-kuen Kwok. I am responsible for the code.

## 2. Pricing participating life insurance policies

*using fully implicit finite difference scheme*

The details of the financial derivative are [here](https://github.com/imfl/derivative-pricing/tree/master/fully-implicit-finite-difference/que.pdf) (PDF).

The Java code to price the strutured product is [here](https://github.com/imfl/derivative-pricing/blob/master/fully-implicit-finite-difference/sol/src) (GitHub).

This course is lectured by Prof. Yue-kuen Kwok. I am responsible for the design and implementation as well as the code.

## 3. Pricing an option on bond

*using a trinomial tree under the Hull-White model*

Price a European call option on the clean price of a bond using a trinomial tree under the Hull-White model. 

The details of the financial derivative are [here](https://github.com/imfl/derivative-pricing/tree/master/trinomial-hull-white/que.pdf) (PDF).

The C code to price the strutured product is [here](https://github.com/imfl/derivative-pricing/tree/master/trinomial-hull-white/sol.c) (GitHub).

### More Information

This project serves as an assignment that I did for *MAFS5040 Quantitative Methods for Fixed-Income Instruments*, a postgraduate-level course that I took at the Math Dept. at HKUST in Spring 2017. This course is lectured by Prof. Lixin Wu. I am responsible for the code.

## 4. Building a classical binomial tree

### More Information

This project serves as an assignment that I did for *MAFS 5260 : Building Financial Applications with Java and VBA*, a postgraduate-level course that I took at the Math Dept. at HKUST in Spring 2017. This course is lectured by Dr. Chung-dak Shum. I am responsible for the code.
