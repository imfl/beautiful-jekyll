I graduated from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)] (https://www.ust.hk) in 2017, with a master degree in financial mathematics.

I spent a memorable 1.5 years in the charming campus by the sea, where half of my time was devoted to financial mathematics, and the rest half to computer science.

Library is my favorite and most frequent venue. There are two seats on LG3 floor which I almost deem as my private property.
