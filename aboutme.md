I graduated from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) at the end of 2017, with a master of science degree in financial mathematics. I spent a memorable 1.5 years in the charming campus by the sea, where I devoted half of my time to financial mathematics, and the other half with computer science. Library that I frequent is my favorite. There are two seats on LG3 floor which I almost deem as my private property.
