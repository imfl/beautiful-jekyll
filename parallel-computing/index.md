The [Bellman-Ford algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman-Ford_algorithm) is an algorithm that computes the shortest paths from one single source vertex to all the other vertices in a weighted directed graph. The weights can be negative.

### MPI

The C++ code is [here](https://github.com/imfl/parallel-computing/blob/master/bf-mpi.cpp) (GitHub).

### OMP

The C++ code is [here](https://github.com/imfl/parallel-computing/blob/master/bf-omp.cpp) (GitHub).

### CUDA

The C++ (CUDA) code is [here](https://github.com/imfl/parallel-computing/blob/master/bf-cuda.cu) (GitHub).

### More Information 

This project serves as a series of assignments that I did for *COMP 5112 Parallel Computing*, a postgraduate-level course that I took at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at HKUST in Spring 2017.
