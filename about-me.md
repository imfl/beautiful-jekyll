I graduated from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in Dec 2017, with a master's degree in financial mathematics.

I spent a memorable 1.5 years in the charming campus by the sea, where half of my time was devoted to financial mathematics, and the rest half to computer science.

Library that I used to frequent is my favorite. There are two seats on the LG3 floor which I almost deem as my private property.

Before that I studied finance in Renmin University of China (a second bachelor's degree in finance, RUC, 2013-2015). Even before that, I was a journalist.
