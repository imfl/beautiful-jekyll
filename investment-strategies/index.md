## A Sector Rotation Trading Strategy in Hong Kong Stock Market

We design and implement a sector rotation trading strategy in Hong Kong Stock Market.

Strategically, we rotate the focus of our investment from one industry sector to another, according to the fluctuations of the business cycle.

The core of our strategy is

1. to detect the stage of the cycle, and
2. to quantify the descriptive recommendations such as strong buy, neutral and sell.

We apply Principal Component Analysis in selecting the stocks, Hidden Markov Model to detect the stage of the business cycle, and employ Monte Carlo meth- ods, with Gibbs sampling ideas, for optimization.

We also discuss using statistical techniques, such as skewness, kurtosis, and variance ratio tests, for Ô¨Åne-tuning our strategy.
